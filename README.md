This code is used to sort through a list of shapes using different sorting Algorithms. 
The code is executable using run configuration in eclipse and through the jar file called Sort.jar

To use run configuration to test the program go to:

Run -> Run configurations... -> Arguments
Once in arguments, under "Program arguments:" is where you can input the commands under the following format:
-fshapes1.txt -Tv -Sb
-ta -sQ -f"shapes1.txt"
-tH -F"path to shapes.txt file o your pc" -sB


In order to run the Sort.jar file, open command prompt and navigate to the location of the Sort.jar and ensure it's in the same area as the shapes.txt.
Once in the correct directory, use the following command formats to test:

java -jar Sort.jar -fshapes1.txt -Tv -Sb
java -jar Sort.jar -ta -sQ -f"shapes1.txt"
java -jar Sort.jar -tH -F"path to shapes.txt file on your pc" -sB
